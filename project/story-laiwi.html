        <p>
          High in the mountains of Angaraes lived two siblings known as the Laiwi brothers.
          Their family took care of alpacas and llamas, and from a young age they learned
          to read the signs of the wind and the color of the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          One dry season, the river that crossed their community began to disappear.
          The elders said that an angered spirit was taking the water away because
          people had stopped respecting the mountains and throwing offerings into the river.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Laiwi brothers decided to climb to the highest peak to ask for forgiveness
          and bring back the water. Along the way they met condors, foxes, and a small
          vizcacha that each gave them advice and simple gifts for the journey.
        </p>
        <p>
          (You can continue writing or adapting the full story here for your students.
          The important part is that the text is readable and appropriate for the audience.)
